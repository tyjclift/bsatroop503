1. "USE YOUR RESOURCES" is the important phrase that all 
Scouts in Troop 503 should know. It means: STOP, THINK: What is around me that 
can help me answer this question or help me solve this problem?...Can I solve it 
myself?...Can I find a person or thing that will help me accomplish this?

2. Whenever you are out in public as a Scout or at a 
Scout function, you will wear your uniform. You do this to show your pride as a 
member of the Boy Scouts of America--a 4 million member organization that has 
had 75 million members since 1910.

3. As a member of the Troop you will go on many 
activities, in many different towns, states and Scout councils. At those times, 
remember that you represent (a) all the members of the Troop; (b) 2,000 Boston 
Minuteman Council members; (c) 12,000 Winchester residents; (d) 4 million Boy 
Scouts; and (e) six million Massachusetts residents. All these at the same time! 
Set a good example.

4. As a member of the Troop, you are a member of a 
Patrol. You receive your information about events through your Patrol. You camp 
and prepare for camping with your Patrol. You can go on your own Patrol 
activities. Your Patrol competes against others both in the Troop and in the 
Council. Do your best to make your Patrol a spirited, well-informed and active 
Patrol.
