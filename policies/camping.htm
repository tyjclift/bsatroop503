face=Arial size=2>1. Attending a camp out or other Troop activity is a privilege 
that is earned by conducting one's self according to the Scout Oath and Scout 
Law.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Radios and other electronic equipment (i.e. TV, 
CD's, Gameboys, etc.) with headphones are allowed at campouts and may be used 
only for bedtime or leader designated free-time listening at low volume or for 
emergency use. This equipment may not be used at the above times if Scouts may 
need to hear warnings or instructions. At any time, the use of these items is at 
the discretion of the Scoutmaster.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Non-Scout games on campouts must be approved by 
the Scoutmaster.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. Patrols have separate camping areas on campouts. 
Scouts must stay out of other patrols' areas unless they are granted permission 
to enter by the Patrol Leader, Assistant Patrol Leader or Acting Patrol Leader. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The adult leaders' area on campouts is off limits 
to a Scout unless a Scout has a problem or is invited by the adult leaders. 
Leadership Corps members and the Senior Patrol Leader are allowed entry at any 
time. It is hard for the adult leaders to carry out their duties with Scouts 
unnecessarily in their area.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. When planning menus, try not to use many 
prepackaged foods. Use raw food where possible. It costs less and promotes good 
cooking skills. Certain activities may dictate food preparation methods (e.g.- 
outdoor camping vs. cooking inside). However, check with the Scoutmaster if in 
doubt. Again, no breakable containers (e.g. glass) will be allowed on Troop 
Campouts and similar activities. If your Patrol has a glass container, it will 
be taken away.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Shopping for food should be done as a Patrol for 
the first activity of each school year. After that, a different two Scouts per 
Patrol will do the shopping for each activity. A parent is asked to accompany 
each shopping trip, but not to do the shopping for the Scouts. (Otherwise, the 
Scouts won't learn for themselves.)</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. For most activities, the Patrol Leader (or his 
appointee) will ask for a certain amount of money for food at the Troop meeting 
before each camp out. This is an advance for the Scouts' shopping. Surpluses 
will be returned; underpayments will be increased after the camp out. This 
advance money is not refundable if a Scout does not go on the camp out.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. The Patrol will not buy snacks. Each Scout is 
allowed to bring a limited amount of snack food on a camp out for personal 
consumption.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. IMPORTANT! All menus must be approved by a member 
of the adult leadership.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. A Scout must attend the last Troop meeting before 
each camp out to be eligible to go on that activity. If he cannot attend that 
meeting, he must call both his Patrol Leader AND the Scoutmaster before the 
meeting. Without doing this, a Scout cannot be guaranteed a place on the trip. 
(...And may have to bring his own equipment and food.)</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. Where possible, the Troop will go on one major 
activity each month plus one minor activity. Special-requirement campouts or 
special-opportunity activities may be scheduled in months where major and/or 
minor activities already exist.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. On the day of a VA Hospital or Woburn Sportsman's 
Club service project, all Scouts (of all ages) who are not working or out of 
town with family are expected to help and participate for some amount of time. 
These two organizations are our support and sponsoring organizations, and Troop 
members must recognize their responsibilities.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. Scouts in elementary or middle school will need 
to fulfill participation requirements for certain activities. For example, a 
particular trip in June may require attendance in either a March or April event. 
Watch your newsletters, calendars or ask the Scoutmaster for details. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>15. Eagle Scouts are expected by the Committee to 
remain active in Troop 503 after the awarding of the Eagle badge. Service to 
one's Troop is part of the responsibility of being an Eagle Scout.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>16. For special events (such as canoe trips, winter 
campouts, or a high-adventure trips) special requirements will be set by the 
Scoutmaster for the fun, safety and health of all, including necessary 
equipment, rank achieved, service points, scout spirit, and necessary merit 
badges earned to help assure that each Scout is capable of making such a trip 
without mishap.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>17. Eligibility to attend some special Troop 
functions must be earned by the Scouts. Participation will be determined by the 
Troop leaders based on advancement as well as good behavior, past participation, 
and Scout spirit. Scouts who do not obey the Scout Law at Troop meetings, 
campouts, or summer camp--accomplishing nothing themselves and disturbing 
others--are not likely to earn approval to attend special events. These are fun 
trips where each Scout must do his share, leadership personnel must be obeyed, 
and accident situations must be prevented.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>18. Troop 503 is available to local or regional Civil 
Defense agencies in the event of a natural disaster, missing person search or 
the like. If called upon parents are asked to assist their sons in preparing the 
necessary clothing, food or tools that may be needed. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>19. When the Troop's Scoutmaster is not present on an 
activity or Troop meeting, he will designate an acting Scoutmaster. The acting 
Scoutmaster will have all the duties and responsibilities as the Scoutmaster and 
will be treated accordingly by the Troop. </FONT></FORM></P></BODY></HTML>
