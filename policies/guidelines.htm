        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>There are two uniform standards: </FONT>
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>Standard - consists of an open collar Boy 
        Scout uniform shirt with badges and insignia worn. Troop hats are

        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Full Uniform is required at special 
        events, such a Courts of Honor, and events where the Troop members will

        sales.</FONT>
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The leader of activity may modify the 
        uniform standard as necessary due to the nature of the event (such as 
        Eagle projects). </FONT>
        <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Troop calendar will indicate these

and merit badges will be presented to the Scout shortly after the award is 
earned. Recognition will also be made at each Court of Honor for those awards 
earned since the previous Court of Honor. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. All Scouts will remain in the Troop meeting area 
during Troop meetings unless excused by an adult leader. The same guideline 
applies to other Troop activities such as campouts. Scouts must not arrive 
excessively early before a Troop meeting--no adults will be there, and 
therefore, it is not safe and can cause the Troop to lose the use of its Troop 
room. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. Your Scout Handbook must be brought to all Troop 
functions unless otherwise specified by the Scoutmaster. A Scout's advancement 
will be tracked in his own Handbook. Equipment lists and LOADS of other 
information can be found in the Handbook. It is well worth reading by both the 
Scout and his parent(s).</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The following are required at Troop 
meetings:</FONT>
<UL>
  <UL><FONT face=Arial size=2>a. Boy Scout Handbook</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial 
    size=2>b. Pen and paper.</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>c. Standard 
    Uniform</FONT>
    <UL>
      <UL><FONT face=Arial size=2>Scouts are checked for neat appearance and 
        proper wearing of the uniform. An outgrown uniform exchange rack will be 
        maintained at the Troop Room for use by all Scouts at no charge.</FONT> 
        <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Note: the Troop Committee removed the 
        neckerchief requirement with the adoption of the Uniform Code in 
        February 12, 1999.</FONT></P></UL></UL></UL></UL><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Each 
new Scout entering the Troop will be given one copy of an application, a health 
form, this guidebook, and other important forms. Parents need to make sure that 
all forms are completed and returned A.S.A.P. Scouts will be provided with a 
Troop custom neckerchief and troop hat. These are very special and unique. The 
fee for a lost neckerchief or hat is $8.00.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. The "Signs Up" signal means that Scouts and 
leaders MUST stop what they are doing and keep quiet to hear an announcement. 
This is for common respect for the person making the announcement.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. Again, "Use your resources" means think about what 
is available to you to help you solve your problem. It is not meant to 
discourage the asking of questions. If you need to know...ask! </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. No food, chewing gum, or drinks are allowed at 
the Troop meetings unless approved by an adult leader in charge. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. No unauthorized items (e.g., tape players, games, 
toys, rubber balls) will be allowed in Troop meetings. The adult leaders reserve 
the right to take such items from a Scout and return them to his parents after 
the meeting. Scouts are not allowed on any floor of VA Building 12 other than 
that on which the Troop Room is located. This is essential to maintain the 
Troop's good standing with the VA Hospital. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. Conduct while on VA Hospital property must be 
exemplary. This is essential in order to allow the Troop to co-exist with VA 
employees in an office building.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>13. Conduct other than that called for in items 11 
and 12 above is punishable by the Scoutmaster and/or Troop Committee and can 
result in suspension from the Troop. Poor conduct puts the Troop at risk of 
losing its meeting place. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. The Troop's philosophy is that all members should 
be considered as individual persons. The leadership will make every effort to 
help a Scout with an issue or problem. Parents are advised to consult the 
Scoutmaster in the event of a problem or special situation, just as the 
Scoutmaster may consult with the parents when appropriate. Parents should inform 
the Scoutmaster of any particular item that parents feel will help the 
Scout.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>15. Boy Scout Troop 503 policy requires supervision 
by a minimum of three (3) parents and/or adult leaders on most activities 
(certain Venture activities for older scouts are self-led) and that 
transportation must be available for the boys and the adults to the destination 
and for the return trip to Winchester. Therefore, in the event that 
transportation requirements and/or the required number of adults is not met for 
a Troop 503 activity, participation in the activity will be determined by the 
Scoutmaster and the adult leaders on the basis of each boy's:</FONT>
