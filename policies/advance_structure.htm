size=2>1. The Troop's advancement philosophy is that a Scout should be 
encouraged to advance at his own pace. It is not the Leaders' goal to produce 
Eagle Scouts for glory's sake.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. The Troop has an Advancement Chairman who keeps 
all advancement records and advises the leadership on Scouts' progress.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Candidate Scouts for the Troop's Leadership 
offices (Senior Patrol Leader (SPL), Assistant Senior Patrol Leader (ASPL), 
ASPL-Venture) shall be at least Star in rank and at least 14 years old before 
they can run for office. A Scout's leadership history and prior conduct are also 
important for nomination. Achieving Star is not a guarantee of eligibility to 
run for office. Voting is open to the entire Troop membership.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The Troop's Patrol Leaders shall be at least First 
Class in rank where possible. Patrol Leaders shall be elected to a 4-month term 
by their Patrol members. In some cases (for example, disciplinary problems or 
inappropriate actions by the Patrol Leader), the Scoutmaster may call for new 
elections.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. The Troop's Assistant Patrol Leaders shall be 
elected for a 4-month term by members of their Patrol.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. All Patrol Leaders and the Senior Patrol Leader 
serve on the Patrol Leaders Council (PLC). The PLC is charged with developing 
meeting and activity plans, discussing Scouting matters among themselves, and 
handling those discipline cases referred by leaders.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. The Troop Guide, Librarian, Scribe, Historian, 
Bugler, Quartermaster (and other posts which may be created) may either be 
elected by the Troop or appointed by leaders' discretion. Leaders shall set 
criteria for these posts if open for election.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Should a Scout enter the Troop at an advanced age 
(ages 13 to 15) or possess unusual ability (before rank ability would ordinarily 
allow him to take a certain position), then the adult leadership reserves the 
right to appoint such a Scout to certain positions.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. Scouts should read their Scout Handbook concerning 
advancement requirements for each rank, including the different types of merit 
badges required for the upper ranks.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. A "Scout of the Month" may be selected by the 
adult leadership based on meritorious Scout action in living up to the Scout 
oath and law. If, in the opinion of the adult leadership, no Scout shows this 
particular achievement, then no award will be given that month.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. Scouts are allowed to trade only certain types of 
patches with scouts from other troops. Badges/patches showing rank (Tenderfoot, 
Second Class, First Class, Star, Life, and Eagle) cannot be traded. Only patches 
showing items such as camporees or summer camp can be traded. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>12. If a Scout is attending a merit badge or other 
advancement course which is taught by his parent, the parent must insure that at 
least 2 other Scouts are also attending the parent's advancement record, where 
possible.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>Troop 503 will pay as shown below for Scout 
leadership training courses:</FONT><BR>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>The Troop Committee reserves the right to modify the 
Troop's percentage of funding from time to time.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>14. Eagle courts of honor are prestigious events 
recognizing scouts' earning of the BSA's highest rank. The Troop's goal is to 
have two Eagle courts of honor per year scheduled at the discretion of the 
Scoutmaster, Chairman and the Committee, aimed to facilitate family 
participation and school schedules. Accordingly, the Committee cannot guarantee 
that an individual Scout will be the only person recognized in a particular 
Eagle ceremony. However, the intent is that there will be no more than three 
Scouts per event.</FONT></FORM></P></BODY></HTML>
