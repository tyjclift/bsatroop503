<DIV align=center><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 
size=4>AIMS</FONT></B></DIV><BR><FONT face=Arial>The Boy Scout program works 
toward three aims. </FONT><BR>
<UL><FONT face=Arial>One is the growth in moral strength and character. We may 
  define this as what the boy is himself, his personal qualities, his values, 
  his outlook.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT face=Arial>The second aim is participating 
  citizenship. Used broadly, citizenship means the boy's relationship to others. 
  He comes to learn of his obligations to other people, to the society he lives 
  in, and to the government that presides over that society.</FONT><BR><BR>
<FONT face=Arial>The third aim of the Boy Scout program is development of physical, 
  mental, and emotional fitness. Fitness includes the body (well-tuned and 
  healthy), the mind (able to think and solve problems),and the emotions (self 
  control, courage, and self respect).</FONT></UL><BR>
<FONT face=Arial>The methods are designed to accomplish these aims. Thus, it is important that you know and 
use the methods of the Boy Scout program. Other methods may be good, but they 
may bring different results - results quite different than we are 
seeking.</FONT><BR>
<DIV align=center><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" color=#000080 
size=4>METHODS</FONT></B></DIV><BR><B><FONT face=Arial 
color=#0000ff>Ideals</FONT></B><B><FONT face=Arial> -- </FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial>The ideals of Scouting are spelled out in the Scout Oath, Scout Law, 
motto, and slogan. The Scout measures himself against these ideals and 
continually tries to improve. The goals are high, and as he reaches for them he 
has control over what he becomes.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Patrols</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial> -- The 
patrol method gives scouts an experience in group living and participating 
citizenship. It places a certain amount of responsibility on young shoulders and 
teaches boys how to accept it. The patrol method allows Scouts to act in small 
groups where they easily can relate to each other. These small groups determine 
troop activities through their elected representatives.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Outdoors</FONT></B><B><FONT face=Arial> -- 
</FONT></B><FONT face=Arial>The Boy Scout program is designed to take place 
outdoors. It is in the outdoors that Scouts share responsibilities and learn to 
live with each other. It is here that the skills and activities practiced at 
troop meetings come alive with purpose.</FONT><BR><FONT face=Arial>Being close 
to nature helps Scouts gain an appreciation for God's handiwork and mankind's 
place in it. The outdoors is the laboratory for Scouts to learn ecology and 
practice conservation of nature's resources.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Non-Outdoors</FONT></B><B><FONT face=Arial> 
-- </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial>Troop 503 has a varied program including 
non-outdoor activities intended to broaden a scout's knowledge and skills. These 
include travel to interesting places which are historical or educational. A goal 
of this program is to develop a scout's understanding of his place in the town, 
nation and culture.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Advancement</FONT></B><B><FONT face=Arial> 
-- </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial>Scouting provides a series of surmountable 
obstacles and steps to overcome them through the advancement method. The Scout 
plans his advancement and progresses at his own pace as he overcomes each 
challenge. The Scout is recognized for each achievement. The steps in the 
advancement system help a boy grow in self-reliance, self-confidence, and the 
ability to help others.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Adult Association</FONT></B><B><FONT 
face=Arial> -- </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial>In his quest for manhood, every boy 
needs contact with men he can copy. The Scoutmaster and his assistants can 
provide a masculine image of the vitality and strength of the Boy Scout program. 
Providing good examples of manhood is one of the methods of Scouting and boys 
learn from the example of their adult leaders.</FONT> 
<P><B><FONT face=Arial color=#0000ff>Personal Growth</FONT></B><B><FONT 
face=Arial> -- </FONT></B><FONT face=Arial>As Scouts plan their activity and 
progress toward their goals they experience personal growth. The Good Turn 
concept is a major part of the personal growth method of Scouting. Boys grow as 
they participate in community service projects and do Good Turns for others. 
There probably is no device so successful in developing personal growth as the 
daily Good Turn.</FONT> 
<P><BR><FONT face=Arial>Frequent personal conferences with his Scoutmaster help 
each Scout to determine his growth toward Scouting's aims. 
</FONT><BR><BR><I><FONT face=Arial>The religious emblems program is also a large 
part of the personal growth method. </FONT></I></FORM></P></BODY></HTML>
