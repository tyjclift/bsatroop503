<FONT face=Arial size=2>1. 
Swiss Army type pocket knives are the only acceptable knife for Scout use. "Buc" 
style knives are not allowed. Knives with blade length beyond three inches (3") 
are not allowed anywhere, anytime. Any exceptions (such as for wood carving 
craft uses) must be approved by the Scoutmaster in advance.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Only Scouts with the "Tote 'n Chip" card in their 
possession can use a knife, ax, saw, or hatchet, at any time, including during 
campouts. Scouts who violate the safety rules of this card will have a corner 
clipped off or even have the card revoked by an adult leader. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. No glass containers will be brought on Scout 
activities. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. All Scouts' parents must fill out a medical form 
for their sons. This form is for leaders' emergency use. In addition, adult 
leaders also need to fill out a medical form. These are absolute requirements 
for Boy Scout Summer Camp for both Scouts and leaders. Christian Scientist 
families should see the Scout-master for appropriate waiver forms for camp and 
Troop activities.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. All injuries, including burns, cuts and 
scrapes--no matter how small--must be reported to an adult leader.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. For safety, no candles, stoves or open flames are 
allowed in or near the tents. Scouts may use lanterns only at the leader's 
discretion, but Scouts may never use lanterns or candles in tents.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Matches and lighters may only be used with a 
purpose; they may not be played with.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. Alcohol, tobacco, or other controlled substances 
(e.g., illegal drugs) are, of course, strictly prohibited.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. All inappropriate items or matter that violate the 
Scout, local, state, or federal law may be turned in to local authorities. 
Possession of such items may lead to any required response by the Leaders and/or 
the Troop Committee. (See section on Troop Scout Law Policy.)</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. All Scouts are required to take a First Aid Merit 
Badge Course when offered if they don't already have the badge. Scouts who 
passed the course more than two years ago encouraged to attend the course, but 
are not given the test. (This refresher course is also recommended by the Red 
Cross.)</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. All Scouts MUST obey the Boy Scouts of America 
Safe Swim Defense Rules. If you don't know them, see the Scout Handbook (page 
229) or the Scoutmaster.</FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
