<FONT face=Arial size=2>1. 
The Scout Law says that a Scout is </FONT><B><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" 
color=#800080 size=2>Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, 
Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent</FONT></B><FONT 
face=Arial size=2>. A demerit is a point issued to a Scout by an adult leader 
for disobeying the Scout Law. The Scoutmaster will assign a work project for 
each demerit received. The Scout must immediately undertake work projects when 
they are issued. The Scout will also be required to print two copies of the long 
version of the entire Scout Law and capitalize that section (or sections) he 
disobeyed. The work project is assigned so that the Scout can provide some 
tangible, positive contribution toward his Troop. The writing of the Scout Law 
is provided so that the Scout can reflect upon his negative actions. The Scout 
cannot advance to the next rank with a demerit on his record. Advancement may 
resume when these demerit-related penalties are completed.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. Troop 503's Scout Law Policy means that when a 
Scout has been issued three demerits within a period of one year, he will lose 
his privilege to attend the next major Troop activity. For every additional two 
demerits a Scout will lose the privilege to attend yet another major 
activity.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. In a serious problem, such as a safety issue or 
insubordination to a leader, the leader must first stabilize the situation and 
inform the Scout that he is "on report". The leader should then "step back" and 
talk with the Scoutmaster (preferably) or another adult leader as to the 
handling of the situation.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. The Troop Committee reserves the right to deal 
with and adjudicate serious problems, including disobedience of the Scout Law. 
</FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. An adult leader will deal with minor problems as 
he sees fit and consistent with the existing situation and scout policy.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>6. The Patrol Leaders' Council (PLC) may deal with 
problems assigned to it by an adult leader. The PLC may meet anywhere, any time. 
The PLC must consider all sides of a problem, discuss the issue, and recommend 
to the Scoutmaster what action should be taken. The Scoutmaster will review the 
decision of the PLC, and, at his discretion, will enforce either that decision 
or a modified version of the decision. The PLC may take on issues on their own 
with permission from the Scoutmaster or Acting Scoutmaster.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>7. Intimidation: The use by a Scout of his size, age, 
strength, weight, appearance or any other factor to frighten, coerce or force 
another Scout into taking or being subjected to any action(s) that would 
otherwise be against his will is strictly prohibited. The Troop Committee 
reserves the right to respond to one Scout's intimidation of another in any way 
appropriate including issuing demerits, suspension or expulsion from Troop 
503.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>8. To avoid future problems in behavior, the adult 
leadership and the Troop Committee reserve the right to do any or all of the 
following:</FONT><BR>
<UL>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>issue demerits</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>revoke a Scout's activity privileges</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>call in parents to confer</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>suspend a Scout from the Troop</FONT>
  <LI><FONT face=Arial size=2>terminate membership in the Troop, and only after 
  a Committee meeting which the Scout and/or his parents may attend if they 
  wish. </FONT></LI></UL><BR><FONT face=Arial size=2>Termination of membership is 
reserved for the most severe problems or cases where undo risk would be taken by 
the Troop if the member remained enrolled.</FONT><BR>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>9. To deal with a negative or unmanageable situation, 
the Committee and/or adult leadership reserve the right to issue three 
"strikes". The first strike is a warning. The second strike is a serious warning 
(the leader may choose to contact the Scout's parents). The third strike means 
"you're out" and the leader will call parents and have them pick up their son 
and take him home from an activity, even if the activity is still in progress. 
Parents should come as quickly as possible in this situation.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>10. In a situation where a Scout violates the Scout 
Law in a public place or setting (such as where there are crowds or at a 
ceremony) or acts in a manner which adversely affects Troop 503, Boston 
Minuteman Council or the Boy Scouts of America, the Troop Committee will invite 
the Scout and his parent(s) to appear before the Committee to explain the 
Scout's actions. </FONT>
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>11. Remember, the Troop's Scout Law Policy assures 
fair and predictable action by the leaders and is designed to make sure that no 
one person spoils the fun of scouting for others. Scouts who live by the Scout 
Oath and Law will have no problems with the Troop's policy, will have more fun, 
and will set a good example to others.</FONT></P>
