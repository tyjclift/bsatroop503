face=Arial size=2>1. Participation in Scouting shall be defined as the manner in 
which a Scout spends his time available for Scouting. A Scout who is involved 
whenever he can is highly participatory. A Scout who misses meetings and events 
and/or consistently spends his Scout time poorly is a low participator. 
Participation is a requirement for all ranks.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>2. A Scout's participation and level of involvement 
in the Troop can fluctuate during the year due to homework, illness, organized 
sports or activities, or other special situations. These situations will occur 
from time to time. Please notify the Scoutmaster if you will be temporarily 
inactive.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>3. Boards of Review for Scout, Tenderfoot, Second 
Class and First Class are arranged by the Advancement Chairman. It is the 
Scout's responsibility to request a Board of Review from either the Scoutmaster 
or the Advancement Chairman.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>4. A Scout who requires a Troop Committee Board of 
Review for Star or Life must give the Committee Chairman advance notice of his 
coming need for a Board of Review. The Committee will make every effort to 
arrange a Board of Review quickly, considering Committee members' schedules and 
prior commitments. Be advised that the Troop committee regularly meets only once 
per month, and, if possible would like to schedule a Board of Review for Star or 
Life with this in mind. So plan ahead.</FONT> 
<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>5. A Scout should prepare for a Board of Review by 
reviewing his Scout Handbook. A Scout is expected to appear for a Board of 
Review in full uniform with proper badges.</FONT></FORM></P></BODY></HTML>
